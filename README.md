# CipherChat

///--------- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ----------///

![CipherChat Logo](docs/assets/logo.png)

CipherChat is a highly secure, serverless messaging application designed for maximum privacy. Users can send encrypted messages directly to their trusted contacts without relying on any central servers. The application features end-to-end encryption, secure local storage, and a user-friendly pairing process via QR codes.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Messages are stored only on users' devices, eliminating the need for central servers.
- **Secure Key Management**: Each user has a unique public/private key pair, securely managed and stored.
- **QR Code Pairing**: Users can easily add trusted contacts by scanning QR codes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for both iOS and Android, with a shared Rust library for core cryptographic functions.

## Technical Highlights

CipherChat leverages Rust for its core cryptographic and networking operations, encapsulated in a shared library used by both the iOS and Android applications. This approach was chosen for several reasons:

- **Performance and Safety**: Rust offers memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector, making it an ideal choice for performance-critical and secure applications.
- **Code Reusability**: By using a shared Rust library, we ensure that critical code is written once and reused across both platforms, reducing the potential for bugs and inconsistencies.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Rust’s ability to compile to native code for both iOS and Android streamlines the development process and ensures that the security and cryptographic features are consistent across platforms.
- **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**: Rust’s robust FFI support allows seamless integration with Swift on iOS and Kotlin on Android, enabling us to build a unified codebase while leveraging platform-specific features and optimizations.
